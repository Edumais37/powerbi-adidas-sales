## Key Insights
### Product Performance
- Footwear outsells apparel 2-to-1 in total sales and dominates in both high and medium margins.

- Menâ€™s street footwear and womenâ€™s apparel are top performers by sales, but succeed with very different margin strategies.

- Medium-margin products drive the highest operating profit due to strong sales volume and decent per-unit profitability.

### Retailer Behavior
- West Gear and Footlocker led in total sales, favoring low-margin, high-volume products.

- Sports Direct emerged as the top seller of high-margin products, particularly in Southern cities.

- Inconsistencies in 2020 retail data suggest onboarding new partners or temporary contract breaks; 2021 shows full retailer engagement across all brands.

 ### Regional Highlights
- The South region sold the most high-margin products despite having lower total sales overall, suggesting strategic potential.

- New York City and San Francisco were the top-grossing cities; however, NYC recorded no sales in 2021, raising questions about distribution.

- Seasonal trends appeared around back-to-school and holiday periods, varying by retailer and product.

### Margin Dynamics
- Average profit per unit increases with margin tier: Low (26%) < Medium (31%) < High (43%).

- Medium-margin footwear offers the best balance of sales volume and profitability.

## Recommended Actions
- Expand high-margin product distribution in the South, leveraging strong Sports Direct performance.

- Investigate West Gearâ€™s success with low-margin volume â€” consider scaling to other markets.

- Capitalize on medium-margin products, especially footwear, to maximize profit at scale.

- Explore product event tie-ins to boost less demanded lines during seasonal spikes.

- Review 2021 NYC sales void â€” logistical issue or market shift?
